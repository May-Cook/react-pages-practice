# react-pages-practice
A test repository to confirm I understand how react interacts with github pages and to ensure I was able to get it working using bun and vite
# how I did it
I followed <a href=https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages>this guide</a>, adapting it for Bun and Vite by:
* using `bun vite practice-app` in place of `npx create-react-app practice-app` and following the instructions to run `bun install` in `./practice-app`
* using `bun` in place of `npm` and `npx`
